Of all of the classifiers, random performs the following from worst to best\\
random (worst) weak classifier (medium) boost (best)\\
There exists a slight improvement using boosting methods.\\
Greater amounts of iterations generally improve accuracy.\\
The algorithms seem robust to changing the split of training and testing data\\
