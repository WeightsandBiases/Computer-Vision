There are many advantages in using integral images.\\
Once the integral image is computed from an image.\\
Obtaining a rectangular summation in any section of  image is in\\
near constant time as there is only one addition and\\
two subtraction operators in A - B - C + D\\
np.sum() is computed in linear time, and computing the sum of an image\\
at a particular region is O(N^2) time.\\
Using np.sum would not be a scalable solution, especially in adaboost,\\
an algorithm where  multiple sections of the image have to be summed.\\
