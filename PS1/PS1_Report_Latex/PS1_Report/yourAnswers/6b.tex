Images are represented in a range of minimum and maximum values. Everything that is represented is relative to that range.\\
Depending on the range, a negative representation may be normal.\\
Negative values also appear occasionally as a result from subtraction operations.\\
For example, if a range of 0 to 255 are used to represent the image, then a negative value would be an error as it cannot be represented.\\
However, negative pixel values can be represented in signed and floating point representations of images.\\
It is important to maintain negative pixel values as everything in image processing is relative.\\
Maintaining the negative pixel values maintains greater fidelity of the image\\
This usually requires converting the image to allow a greater range to be expressed.\\
This may be done by converting the image into signed or floating point representations.\\
