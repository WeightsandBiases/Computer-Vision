The green channel most resembles a grayscale conversion of the original \\
I believe this is because green is the closest to the average colors of the image.\\
The elements of green make up some of the blue (lower portion of the image) and yellow (left portion of the image)\\
In contrast, blue and red are two opposite colors. The blue channel does not contain colors of the red, and vice versa.\\
This makes it hard for the red and blue channels to represent this particular picture with yellow, green, red, white, and blue as a gradient.\\
A short read on https://medium.com/hd-pro/human-vision-and-digital-color-perception-91db3b19cc7f
and https://www.redsharknews.com/technology/item/4741-human-vision-and-why-the-colour-green-is-so-important lead to the finding that the human eye is more sensitive to green light.\\
The Bayer Array has an additional green sensor because of this reason. \\
