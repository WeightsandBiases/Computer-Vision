With the same sigma value used in the Gaussian noise that was applied,\\
the blue channel looks cleaner to me.\\
As was discussed in 6a, it appears that the human eye is more sensitive to green channels\\
I was able to discern a difference in the noise at a sigma value of 15 for the green channel.\\
However, it took a much larger sigma value of 50 for me to discern a difference for the green channel.\\
This confirms that the human eye can pick out certain color channels more than others. How fascinating!\\
