I spent 8 hours tweaking the various parameters such as histeris, thresholds, and accumulator values but in the end I failed to properly detect most street signs.\\
I learned that it is very hard to detect things in real life using primative detection methods\\
that I implemented specifically for cartoon images of signs.\\
Edge cases, such as how traffic lights are actually black when the bulbs are not lit up \\
and blending with the dark light housing itself made it super hard to pick out circles \\
as there was not a lot of contrast for the houghCircles to try to identify.\\
I suppose this was a "big learning from mistakes" moment, and this is why vision is such\\
a hard and unsolved area of computer science.  I am enthusiastic to learn more methods to\\
tackle these hard problems and eventually see if Convolutional Neural Networks would help \\
this scenario\\
