Lucas Kanade does not work very well for large image shifts, especially on ShiftR40.png. \\
This is because of the underlying assumption that shifts are small, and U and V are set \\
equal from one image to the next.\\

The results were better when larger gaussian kernels are used to blur the image.\\
This makes sense as larger gaussian kernels can make the images appear similar.\\
This is precisely why, when building image LK pyramids later in the assignment, \\
images are smoothed first prior to downsampling.\\
I scaled the gaussian kernel's sigma values using OpenCV's default scaling equations\\
sigma = 0.3 * ((k_size - 1) * 0.5 - 1) + 0.8\\
